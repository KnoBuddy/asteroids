# asteroids game

# Current Game:
# Player moves with WASD
# Asteroids spawn and move randomly
# Player can shoot asteroids
# Bigger asteroids split when shot, and small ones are destroyed

# Additions wanted in priority from top to bottom:
# Player rotation follow mouse instead of WASD
# Crosshair follows mouse
# Collisions between asteroids and semi accurate physics bounce
# Fix bullets to spawn at tip of ship, not from center
# Add score, menu screen, game loop
# Add power ups that change gun type or increase rate of fire
# Levels with different speeds and types of asteroids
# Color different types of asteroids.
